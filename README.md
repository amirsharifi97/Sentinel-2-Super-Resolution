# Sentinel-2 SuperResolution
Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 RGB Images with VENµS Reference Images

https://doi.org/10.3390/ECRS2023-16863

In this we tried to enhance spatial resolution of sentinel-2 images in visible bands using real ground-truth data VENµS images.

we used SEN2VENµS paired tensors to do this research.
